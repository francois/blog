My name is François Beausoleil, and I live in Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada. I was born in 1973, and that makes me more than 40 years old !

I started coding in the early 80s on an Adam, from Colecovision. I then upgraded to the Commodore 64, diverted through the Amiga 2000HD (with a 40 MiB HD, no less !), and then I started my way onto PCs.

In early 2005, I made the plunge, and started my own company: International Technological Solutions. In late 2009, I received an offer from Bloom Digital Platforms Inc., a former customer.

In 2011, I was the technical co-founder of Seevibes, with Laurent Maisonnave. In late 2016, I moved on to other projects, after having learned my way around RabbitMQ, Puppet and a ton of other products and services.
